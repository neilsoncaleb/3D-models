# CAD Designs  

This repo is a collection of my CAD projects and prototypes.  
It includes work I’ve done while learning **mechanical design, 3D modeling, and problem-solving** through practical projects.  

## 📖 Projects Included  
- 🔧 **CR-10 Max Conversion** – Modifying a 3D printer to a CoreXY gantry system (in progress)  
- 🚗 **Automotive Parts & Fixtures** – Small CAD models to support workshop tasks  
- 🛠️ **Experimental Prototypes** – Designs exploring new ideas and concepts  

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- SolidWorks  
- Fusion 360  
- FreeCAD  
- Onshape (when cloud access was helpful)  

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This  
I’m building these projects as part of my journey in **design, engineering, and technology**.  
For me, CAD isn’t just about models — it’s about **problem-solving, learning how things work, and finding better ways to build and create**.  
Every project is a step toward becoming more skilled, creative, and capable in both **technical work and leadership**.  

## 📌 Notes  
These projects are learning-focused and part of my growth as I explore **mechanical design, prototyping, and innovation**.
