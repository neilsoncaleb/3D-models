# Linear Rods Bearing Bracket

This part is designed to support the **motion system** in the CoreXY conversion.  
It mounts at a **gantry corner** and provides secure alignment for linear guides and extrusions.  

## 📐 Purpose
- Holds **two 8 mm linear rails with bearings**.  
- Clamps to a **2040 aluminum extrusion**.  
- Supports a **12 mm linear rail** at the gantry corner.  

## 🔧 Notes
- Designed for rigidity and smooth linear motion.  
- Placement is critical for maintaining proper CoreXY belt path and stability.  
- This is an early prototype — dimensions may need tuning depending on tolerances.
