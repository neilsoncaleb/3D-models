# 2040 to Linear Rods & Spindle Attachment

This part connects the **spindle/leadscrew block** to the motion system, tying together the structural extrusion and supported rail.  

## 📐 Purpose
- Attaches the **spindle / leadscrew block** to the gantry system.  
- Connects the block to the **12 mm supported linear rail**.  
- Secures the assembly to a **2040 aluminum extrusion**.  

## 🔧 Notes
- Provides alignment between extrusion, rail, and spindle for smooth Z-axis motion.  
- Ensures rigidity and reduces flex at the mounting point.  
- Prototype version — may need adjustments for spindle block tolerances and spacing.
