# CR-10 Max → CoreXY Conversion Parts

This folder contains the CAD files, designs, and prototypes for converting a **Creality CR-10 Max 3D printer** into a **CoreXY gantry system**.  
The goal of this project is to improve **speed, precision, and mechanical stability** while experimenting with custom modifications.

## 📂 Files in This Folder
- `gantry-plate.step` – Base plate design for CoreXY conversion  
- `idler-mount.stl` – Mount for belt idler pulleys  
- `motor-mount.stl` – Stepper motor bracket for CoreXY layout  
- `belt-clamp.stl` – Clamp piece to hold GT2 belt ends  
*(More parts will be added as the project progresses)*
